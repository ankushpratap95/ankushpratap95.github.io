Starting Fall 2022, I will be starting my MS Thesis under the guidance of Prof Yao Wang(Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Biomedical Engineering) who heads the NYU Video Lab. 

I will be working on a project related to analysis of brain cancer using deep learning architectures. I aim to complete it before May 2023.
