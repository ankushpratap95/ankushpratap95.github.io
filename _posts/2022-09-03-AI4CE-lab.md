I am very happy to announce that I have joined AI4CE Lab (headed by Prof Chen Feng) and I'll be doing my research 
under the guidance of Prof Chen Feng and Chao Chen (Phd student)starting Fall 2022. I'll be working on the creation, modelling and analysis of 
different deep learning architectures for Scene Summarization project.
