🌟 Exciting News! 🌟

I'm thrilled to share that I've been accepted as a **PhD student** at **New York Institute of Technology New York**, starting Fall 2024! I will be diving deep into Computer Science with a focus on Deep Learning and Affective Computing under the guidance of **Prof. Houwei Cao**.

My research will aim to study and develop machines that can recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human emotions. 

This journey will be both challenging and rewarding, and I can't wait to contribute to advancing AI and its applications in understanding human emotions.

I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to my parents, family, friends, and everyone who has supported me on this journey, especially the incredible faculty during my master’s program at **New York University**. Your guidance and encouragement have been invaluable.

Thank you to everyone who has supported me along the way. Here's to the next chapter of innovation and discovery! 🚀

Har Har Mahadev 🙏
