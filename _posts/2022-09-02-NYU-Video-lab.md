I am very happy to announce that I have joined NYU Video Lab (headed by Prof Yao Wang) and I'll be doing my research 
under the guidance of Prof Yao Wang and Chris Liu (Phd student)starting Fall 2022. I'll be working on the creation, modelling and analysis of 
different deep learning architectures on NYUMets dataset.
