Some of the important projects I undertook:

1. Contributed to the "Scene Summarization" project, mentored by Prof. Chen Feng. This project, SceneSum, focuses on condensing extensive image collections (scenes) into a concise set of key images that highlight spatial diversity. The work is currently in the process of review for the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), and its details can be accessed via the arXiv link: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17940">Scene Summarization on arXiv </a>.

2. Successfully completed my Master's thesis, supervised by Prof. Yao Wang, on the topic "Segmenting Metastatic Brain Tumors Using Deep Learning". This research involved an in-depth analysis of the NYUMets dataset, employing various temporal segmentation techniques in neural networks. The thesis is publicly available and can be accessed here: <a href="https://ankushpratap95.github.io/thesis_ankush.pdf"> Master's Thesis by Ankush Pratap</a>.
