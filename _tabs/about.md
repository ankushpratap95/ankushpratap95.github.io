Hello folks, I am **Ankush Pratap Singh** (my friends call me Alex too). I am a masters student in Computer Engineering at **New York University**. I moved to New York in 2021 and have been living here since. I have a keen interest in Machine Learning and Deep Learning with a particular emphasis on computer vision. As a deep learning student, I like to implement different architectures ranging from LeNet CNN to WaveNet GANs. Along with deep learning, I have an interest in Big data as well specially recommender systems. 

I did my Btech from **Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology Dwarka (New Delhi)** and soon after graduation, I took up a job as a software engineer.
After working for about 3.5 years in the Indian IT(software) industry, where I was mostly involved as a full stack developer, I decided to move back to academia.

Here at New York University, I've had the pleasure of studying under some really qualified and knowledgable professors and later on working as Graduate Teaching assistant as well for a couple fo them. 

I enjoy teaching and I truly believe in what Richard Feynman said, "I you want to master something, teach it". So, I make sure whenever I study something, I try teaching those topics to some other students or colleagues of mine.

Apart from studies, I enjoy watching sports. I am a huge cricket fan. I love watching movies, theatres, broadways. I like meeting people of different backgrounds and listening to their stories about their culture, life and beliefs.

I have provided my contact details in one of the tabs, so if anyone want to connect or share something, I would love to connect.
